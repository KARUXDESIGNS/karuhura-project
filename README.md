# Smart Packing System

This is a simple web-based application that helps track and manage packages. The system allows users to add new packages, view existing packages, and update the status of the packages (e.g., mark them as "shipped").
- Add new packages with weight, contents, and destination.
- View all packages in the system with their details.
- Update package status to "shipped."
- Built using PHP and MySQL for the backend.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used for handling database interactions and page rendering.
- **MySQL**: Database management system used to store package details.
- **HTML/CSS**: For page structure and styling.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework used for responsive design.

Before running the project, you need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- **PHP**: Make sure PHP is installed (XAMPP, WAMP, or any other local server setup will work).
- **MySQL**: Database server to manage the database (again, XAMPP or WAMP will include MySQL).
- **A web browser**: To access the application.

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-packing-system.git
